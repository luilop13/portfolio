Professional Profile
--------------------

Machine Learning Engineer with 2.5 years of overall experience in defense systems, radar technology, 
and applied machine learning. Currently specializing in Deep Reinforcement Learning at Indra 
with a proven track record in building production-ready ML solutions, from high-fidelity Unity 
simulations to ONNX/Docker deployments ensuring sim-to-sim portability.

Previously designed and specified critical radar systems deployed across Germany's national 
airspace (`€100M+ DFS contract <https://www.indracompany.com/en/noticia/indra-revamps-germanys-entire-air-surveillance-network-new-art-radars-ensure-safer-digital>`_), including fault detection logic and algorithms managing 
2500+ simultaneous targets. 

Strong background in scientific research in nuclear fusion and nuclear physics, having developed automated 
ML analysis tools for the `EUROfusion project <https://euro-fusion.org/eurofusion/members/spain/>`_ at CIEMAT as a Master's Thesis Student, achieving 96.4% accuracy 
in plasma discharge classification and delivering software now in daily use at Spanish fusion facilities 
(TJ-II stellarator). Previously awarded the competitive Ministry of Education Collaboration Grant 
to conduct nuclear physics research at Universidad de Huelva, where I designed custom test-benches 
and PCB interfaces for state-of-the-art silicon and diamond radiation detectors used in 
triple-alpha particle detection experiments within the `G.R.I.T. project <https://grit.in2p3.fr/>`_ framework.

Professional Experience
-----------------------

Machine Learning Engineer @ Indra
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Period:** March 2025 - Present

* Implemented and tuned Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms (PPO and SAC) in Python for an airborne radar search-and-track mission, enabling the radar to autonomously scan and follow areas of interest in real time.
* Built a high-fidelity Unity simulation environment to validate DRL agents under realistic flight and sensor conditions, using C#.
* Designed novel zone-tracking reward functions and mathematical performance metrics, providing a quantitative framework for benchmarking and comparing alternative DRL strategies.
* Deployed DRL models into production using ONNX and Docker, ensuring portability across different simulation environments (sim-to-sim).

Systems Engineer @ Indra
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Period:** May 2023 - March 2025

* Designed and specified the RDFT system (Radar Data and Fusion Tracker) deployed across Germany's national radar network (`DFS, €100M+ contract <https://www.indracompany.com/en/noticia/indra-revamps-germanys-entire-air-surveillance-network-new-art-radars-ensure-safer-digital>`_), architecting the BITE (Built-In Test Equipment) fault detection logic, and defining algorithms as the overload management one for 2500+ simultaneous target capacity.
* Developed a MATLAB-based testing application to validate RDFT performance against EUROCONTROL and DFS operational requirements.
* Specified the software specifications for the PSR2D Neo, Indra's new 2D Primary Surveillance Radar.

Master's Thesis Student @ CIEMAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Period:** October 2024 - June 2025

* Collaborated with the CIEMAT to develop my master’s thesis regarding nuclear fusion and machine learning within the framework of the `EUROfusion project <https://euro-fusion.org/eurofusion/members/spain/>`_.
* Built PCAI Tool, a MATLAB GUI automating the analysis of 60,000+ time-series plasma discharges stored in relational databases.
* Implemented SQL-based data management to query and preprocess large datasets originally in MS Access format.
* Integrated SVM classifiers, achieving 96.4% accuracy and 93.8% F1-score in automatic detection of collapse events, replacing manual human inspection.
* Delivered a modular, scalable software architecture, now in daily use by CIEMAT scientists for the TJ-II stellarator and planned for deployment at the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) facility in Germany.

Undergraduate Research Assistant @ Universidad de Huelva
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Period:** September 2021 - July 2022

* As a recipient of the Ministry of Education Collaboration Grant, I worked with the University of Huelva's Department of Electrical and Thermal Engineering, Design and Projects on nuclear physics research within the framework of the `G.R.I.T. project <https://grit.in2p3.fr/>`_.
* Designed a test-bench for strip radiation detectors with specific nuclear physics instrumentation.
* Characterized and tested state-of-the-art silicon and diamond nuclear radiation detectors for the detection of triple-alpha particles.
* Designed the PCB of the test-bench's electrical interface using Eagle.

Volunteering
